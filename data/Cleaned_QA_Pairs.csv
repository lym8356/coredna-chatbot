You get to enjoy the park when you want to and as often as you would like, without having to mow the lawn, water the flowers and maintain the jungle gym.

Many are inflexible systems that require heavy customization and 3rd party apps to get your website connected with other systems without custom interfaces making it hard to share information and create workflows.Poor Performance. Visitors are often left waiting for the website to load. Errors appear without reason. You're learning about security issues through the news. You just don't trust the software.Limited Support. It’s 3 am, your site is down, but most alternatives only offer 24 hour email support--no chat, and live voice (if available) won’t wake for 3-4 hours. Can you spell F.I.R.E.D?Incomplete Products. They sell you a car with 3 wheels--their system won’t get your job done… without countless 3rd party apps, or dreaded plugins (each with various levels of non-support, no single point of accountability. or risk of serious security holes).

If you're looking for a responsive platform that will make your life easier, this is the one you need.For more information, a decoupled platform is a web application platform that uses a decoupled architecture to provide a responsive user interface. A decoupled architecture separates the presentation layer from the business logic and data access layers, allowing each layer to be developed independently. This separation of concerns makes it possible to develop the presentation layer using a variety of technologies including responsive web design.The advantage of using a decoupled responsive platform is that it allows for a more agile development process. The presentation layer can be developed and deployed independently of the business logic and data access layers, meaning that changes to the user interface can be made without affecting the rest of the application. This can be particularly useful when developing applications that need to be compatible with a variety of devices and screen sizes.When it comes to the headless platform, it allows businesses to manage their e-commerce site without the need for a traditional web design interface. This type of platform uses an API to connect the back-end e-commerce system to the front-end content management system, making it possible to manage e-commerce site content from a single interface.It gives you the flexibility over the front-end as well as the ability to integrate with all devices, support emerging trends like voice search, and more. Do you want to learn more about Headless Commerce? 👉 Download our Headless Commerce Guide GET IN TOUCH TODAYSchedule a one-to-one consultation with your product specialistHere’s what you can expect:Walkthrough: An introduction of the Core dna platformAnalysis: Personalized recommendations based on your  business needs.Case studies: How other businesses have used Core dna to scale more efficiently Request a Demo "

What & Why Core dna: An Overview [Video],"A 10-minute overview of why Core dna and how we help our customers build, manage, and scale websites.GET IN TOUCH TODAYSchedule a one-to-one consultation with your product specialistHere’s what you can expect:Walkthrough: An introduction of the Core dna platformAnalysis: Personalized recommendations based on your  business needs.Case studies: How other businesses have used Core dna to scale more efficiently Request a Demo Video transcriptionWelcome to the Core dna customer Introduction.In this presentation, we will showcase the key reasons that Core dna is a platform of choice for mid-market companies . We will demonstrate some of the values that Core dna has for your business and also some use cases where Core dna is being used.Why Core dna is a platform that has been around now for over five years, and it was born out of an agency in Australia. The name Core dna is a reference to the DNA that we all share and the fact that what makes us unique is the way that DNA sequence, in the same way Core dna brings together a large number of pre-built applications under the same dashboard.Using a single platform, we're able to build and manage content marketing, eCommerce, community and intranet properties. Some of the key advantages of Core dna is that the product is ready to go. It's been pre-built, so there's no need for plug-ins, there's no need for backend development, and it is hosted on an enterprise platform that is extendable and ready for your business.In addition, you get the enterprise value. Without the enterprise price tag, Core dna comes prepackaged at a fixed price per month and all you pay for is what you use.Finally, Core dna will never be out of date. We have a team of R&D developers who are constantly putting in new features, updating patches and providing improvements to the infrastructure to make your website faster, more secure and scalable. A lot of the development in R&D comes from our customer requirements. We don't just build technology for technology sake, we build it based on the needs that our customers share with us. So why does is there a need for a product like Core dna in today's digital landscape is transforming very quickly. Our customers are far more demanding and as a company you need a platform to stay ahead of both your competitors and the demands that the digital landscape puts on you. We believe that Core dna is uniquely placed to help with the acceleration and growth of your business. We help with simplifying website complexity, making it easier for you to get onto a platform and grow as that as your needs and your business require coding assets in the cloud. As a product it allows you to scale quickly without the infrastructure requirements and needs that you would if it was on-premise. You can turn on Core dna very quickly. As a platform, we allow you, the customer, to focus on value adding for your customers, not spending your budgets on technology builds or technology fixes, or the latest ideas that your tech team may come up with.In addition, we provide a platform that allows you to deliver a stronger engagement as all our applications are on the same platform and can speak to each other.Finally, speed. Speed is one of the elements in the digital landscape that people now looking for long. Gone are the times where you could deliver a solution in months. People are now looking for days and weeks. So in terms of the value that I can deliver to your business:Firstly, no software licensing. Our our fees are one flat fee per month that is based on your traffic usage. The platform is pre-built, so all the applications exist. They're ready for you to use. All you need to do is put a skin or a template over the top and they're ready for you to use within your environment. We deliver enterprise cloud, so we have redundancy, we have infrastructure that can scale globally, we have high availability and we have continuous backup. In addition, we also deliver advanced security. Not only do we have white hat hackers on the team, but we have built into our infrastructure network layer, application layer an intrusion detection to ensure that no one comes close to your valuable data. We also have what we believe is speed to market. Because of the way the platform has been built, we're able to reduce the risk of your technology projects and get you to the market quicker. With over 4500 updates a year, we believe our platform will never be out of date. You'll never need to read a patch or fix a security bug. It will always be there. And from a support point of view, we have a 24/7 DevOps crew who manage all the upgrades, all the infrastructure and keep an eye on all the things that are happening in the platform. And finally, we have a support desk that is there to help you when you have questions that need to be answered. When you look at our stack, we've actually transformed the way that websites are now billed. Historically, on the left is an indication of all the different components and not all of them. Actually, it's a subset of all of the components that you would need in today's environment. Coordinate takes care of a large proportion, leaving the UX and design and the front end templating for you to to build quickly and build in in an agile manner. You don't have to commit to a large, complex project. You can phase these features in over time, allowing you to get a product to market, get some customer feedback, and then make refinements as you move along. We also power some of the large brands in the world. We have companies like Nintendo, like Siku are one of the largest recruitment companies and online search companies, and we have a diverse cohort of customers ranging from hotels to fast moving consumables right through to B2B organizations. So looking at some of the examples that we've built out, this is Nintendo.One of the key elements company was security. They joined us back in 2007 and and have had over 200 website properties that have been built on the platform. So coordinated multi site management features were a key consideration when Nintendo were looking for a platform. Today, hundreds of changes find their way to the website and allowing the company to make releases quickly, allowing them to also develop in parallel, not having to wait for the first release to go out, followed by the next one. Teams are able to develop concepts and ideas in parallel and deploy them as needed. Frontier Touring is also a large customer that has been with us for many years. Frontier is an event management and concert management company, one of the largest in Australia. In terms of database, they have over 3 million subscribers who joined to receive event tickets ahead of the public. The system allows you to see the concerts that are there, engage with the concert and buy tickets for those concerts. As an example, traffic flows through the system can reach over 30,000 concurrent users. And second, and we have to manage the large traffic flows when when concerts go on sale and consumers are looking to get the best seat. Provision is one of the largest optical franchise companies in Australia. One of the key features of this solution is the franchise application, which allows provision to list its over 500 retailers, their locations, and allow them to manage all the marketing information that they have at a local area.From the platform. Retailers can log into Kodi and upload changes to their personal franchise store and also upload specials and events into the back end of the system. A booking engine manages all appointments and allows each of the franchisees to liaise directly with customers. In addition, Provision has a personalization engine that fits for their four segments, making the site change completely for each of the segments of their of the community. North Nursery is a local Bostonian, B2B and B2C retailer. The interesting challenges with this organization was the diversity of its products. With over 50,000 products in the catalog, there was quite a complex multi tier pricing and also advanced shipping to allow them to be able to shift soil and gloves with similar orders. Recently. Northeast Nursery has now moved into the B2B and wholesale world where the existing catalog was used to create a wholesale version of the website for them to be able to have on mobiles and make ordering quick and easy for their customers. Slim Road is another example of a franchise, but with in this case, with a specialized e-commerce that was tailored for each of the website franchisees that use the slim road product. Franchisee C's would get a custom look and feel with a centralized e-commerce that they all used.  This allowed the integration of an e-commerce into the existing franchised website without any impact. Tivoli Audio is an example of a complex e-commerce delivery with over 15 stores globally. System was used to provide both B2B and B2C solutions, the beta based solutions for distributors around the world and the B2C for all the various customers. The system also had a complex integration with SAP for both client product and order information. And for each of the sites there was localization required for payment gateways, third party logistics and also inventory. Pacific Marketing International, or PMI, is a good example of a data set customer. The manufacturer of iconic water bottles and thermoses was looking for a platform that could deliver its multi brand experience. The company has over four brands and is looking to drive both B2B and B2C for those brands using Core dna. They were able to deliver an advanced marketing platform coupled with an e-commerce platform. What we're also able to do is provide seamless integration into their Oracle ERP system to help provide inventory information and support request information. When you think about Core dna. Just finally, this is the status of our company. Been in business for a number of years and launched Core dna in 2014. We have over 40 staff in four countries. We have over 2000 websites, 400 customers."

Core dna Solutions: An Overview [Video],"A 15-minute overview of different marketing, eCommerce & intranet solutions that run on Core dna.Video transcription: Core dna Solutions overviewWelcome to the introduction of Core dna. Over the next few minutes, I'm going to take you through some of the solutions that we've developed on Core dna to give you an insight into the versatility of the platform and also what is possible from one single platform with endless solutions. So, starting off, we have of our friends at Nintendo. This is a site that delivers over 200 different assets that drives all the marketing for the business in Australasia. There are many features on this site to go through, but some of the key ones are each of the games gets their own page and for each page it can actually have its own built in site. Recently, Nintendo moved into doing some ecommerce from the same site and also provides their customer service and support from here. So anytime someone has some questions they need answer, they can come into the portal and have a look at the questions and answers and also engage with the through a ticketing system. Another type of marketing site. It's driven by a company called Seek. This is a very good example of an integrated platform to a master platform. So here the main business that Seek are involved in is job search. So this job search environment here is driven by their own platform, their own server farm and their own infrastructure. But anytime you go outside of the job search, you end to coordinate seamlessly. And this has been done using. Reverse proxying and our sophisticated infrastructure to be able to easily transition people from one site to another while maintaining the look and feel and also the site credentials. Here is another example of a marketing site where we are able to provide content. We're able to provide home designs and more of a B2B offering for people looking for something to showcase their customers. Another example here is King and Wilson 100 year old removal company who uses core DNA to drive all their legion. So this site itself not only provides the content marketing, but also provides the quoting engine for people to be able to convert from an inquiry through to the implementation right through to their back end system. Coordinate doesn't just do content, but it also can do what we call directories. Frontier is one of the largest, if not the largest, Asia Pacific tour operator who brings concerts and comedy tours and has a database of over 3 million people. What we have here is an example of the platform where Frontier is able to showcase each of the events, the venue dates, people can buy tickets, we're able to see some of the videos, some other types of media in terms of music, various packages, and also tour information that people may be interested in. All the tours that are currently running are here and what we also have is everything to us stored since the organization started. The challenges with a site like this. Is the spikes in traffic that occur when people are looking to buy their tickets for concerts. They all come at once and try to get their ticketing as quickly as possible. Venues to Events is another example of a directory system. And here what we showcase is venue operators, suppliers and wedding operators in one easy to use website. We can see here the various search criteria that you can have. You could pick a state. Once you pick a state, you could pick a region, you could pick types of venues you're interested in and then once you find your venue you can just press search and the system will go away and find all the venues. Now venue operators have the ability to log into the system and provide updates to their content, to their function information, to image information and provide specials. In addition, all inquiries are actually sent through the venue and are managed through the platform.  This is another example of a similar system and similar implementation. But this is more for restaurants and function venues. So you click on restaurants for a particular city and you can scroll through and see the restaurant. And again the venue operators here have the ability to go in and update their imagery and also take bookings and function inquiries. We also do a lot of work for government and so here is an example of a government site in one of the dates of Australia and this is really three sites in one.  So you can see here we have community health care professionals and health service providers and we can actually switch between them and see the information that's presented. In addition, here they run according to Events platform and people are able to look at events that are up and coming.  And register for them. And in the back end there is the ability for the administrators to administer the system in terms of the event. Another example of a government site more around donations and making people, people aware of what's going on.Again, they run the events environment and they're able to gather donations. cordine also has a recruitment system built into it for jobs and job search. And this is an example of some of the abilities that we have. So you can actually filter through job types and find jobs that are posted here. And candidates can also leave their own resumes and engage with the recruitment company directly. One of the major pillars of the platform outside of content is its ecommerce capabilities and we offer a variety of ecommerce. So starting with a consumer ecommerce so this is a good example of a consumer site where people can engage. We have the shopping cart and within the shopping cart we can have hundreds of features including faceted search, a variety of really cool features in terms of making products seamless and easy to engage with and be able to run sort of endless scrolling for those that are interested in it. The look and feel of all these sites varies considerably but the majority of everyone runs off the same core platform. So moving along, what we also have is an example of language modification. So typically run over 30 different sites around the world and each one has its own language and products and. And eCommerce back end in terms of warehousing and ERP system. In addition, Tivoli also use Core dna to drive their media center. They can select images and then download those images either as a package or as a zip file to be used in their own media. It also supports videos and other forms of media like documents and so on. So this is Ego Pharmaceuticals. It's a pharmaceutical provider. So these companies require a higher level of security but also a significant ability to offer various standards and documentation for the products that they sell. We also have other customers that are what we call direct-to-consumer clients who manufacture their own products and then have multiple brands where they distribute those products, both in an omnichannel way. PMI is a good example of this. This is a company that produces thermoses on a number of different brands and Core dna drives all the different brands themselves. So from their major brand called Stanley, where you have thermoses and vacuum flasks right through to Slant, which is Party products, and Aladdin, which is different types of water bottles and coffee mugs that they offer.  Northeast Nursery is another example of an eCommerce platform that we support. The reason this is. An interesting platform to go through is that it's complexity in terms of the products that it has. So you have everything from turf right through to seeds, right through to plants, supplies in terms of clothing, landscape supplies and also seasonal supplies like at the moment snow shovels and ice melts and so on. Core dna here provides a flexible infrastructure for people to get to what they need really quickly and once they've arrived, they can then refine their search based on the criteria that they have. Northeast Nursery is also now moving into what we call a wholesaler portal. And in this example here, what we're seeing is we're moving far more to an eCommerce that is easy for people to use and engage with. We've rewritten the back end system so it communicates asynchronously so if someone's on their mobile phone, they can quickly add something to the carton. And you can see there that I'm adding two items one after the other or they can favorite a product to then have a favorite for later on when they want to reorder these products. The wholesale portal uses a different engagement on the front end to make it fast and also to be easy to use on a mobile. Gifting is also another area that we do well with. So we have a Langham Hotels as a customer and we're able to create gifts and gift vouchers. And these vouchers then processed using a system at the back end and the vouchers are sent out to the customer in paper form and they're able to be redeemed. Either partially or wholly at the hotel itself. So there's a management system around the gifting that's provided. We also have a large number of B to B clients who use the eCommerce for their beta B applications. So we have here a company called Designer Doorware that uses core DNA for all its door handles. And you're able to configure the door handle and you're asked a series of questions. And once that's done, you can actually add it to your shopping cart. And once you're ready to go, you can then process your shopping cart login and receive quotes or send a spec sheet to yourself. Fuse code is also another good example of the reason I'm showing you this is that it's an example of a complex product. So low voltage fuses and the fuses are categorized in a variety of ways and people then want to be able to engage with a specific category of fuse they can, and within that you can see the different voltages and currents that are available. This site does not engage in any transactions, but people can send a quote for the particular fuse that they want to inquire with. In addition to all those products, we also have solutions for the internet. So a number of our clients use our product to drive their intranets. So they have document management, they have various dashboards that they run for themselves, they're able to promote news. And here you can see a company that has multiple retail outlets that uses the product for merchandising, for all the people and policies, for a bunch of their marketing, finance, retail operations and supply chain. Another example of an Internet is Teamflow. This is the product that Courtney uses itself and this system offers four major functions and solutions. Firstly, project collaboration. So you're able to go in and see the various projects that you're you're working on and within those projects you're able to see tasks, activity, milestones, timesheets and the people that you're collaborating with.  It has a support ticketing environment where people can lodge tickets either through email or through the ticket system itself and others can collaborate on it. A Wikipedia that allows you to create a series of markdown or HTML or any other forms of pages that can then be used for documentation and to be searched. Ideation engine for people to engage with interesting ideas they may have. And a time sheeting system that allows you to capture time shooting for service workers on a daily basis. So you can see progress, you can see how accountable they are, what kind of billable versus non billable, and how they're progressing to budget. All this is also wrapped in a reporting engine that can produce a number of different reports for you to drive the business. I hope this has given you a good insight into what's possible. GET IN TOUCH TODAYSchedule a one-to-one consultation with your product specialistHere’s what you can expect:Walkthrough: An introduction of the Core dna platformAnalysis: Personalized recommendations based on your  business needs.Case studies: How other businesses have used Core dna to scale more efficiently Request a Demo "

The coordinate platform is completely decoupled from the UX. So front end development teams can actually build complex front end users lined interactions for customers while being able to use standardized language to talk to Core dna.I've just logged into an IDE, just a normal IDE. And what you'll notice about this on the left hand side is a structure of how this particular site, this demonstration site that we're working from, is structured.You'll see that it has assets that are there. It'll have the modules which are the Core dna applications that are being used. It will have a templates directory where we have the base templates. It'll have a template directory which is where the compile templates go.It may have a web images directory. You'll see the node modules has been installed as we'll be using Gulp in this particular project to build out our JavaScript and we'll have our source JavaScript and then finally we'll have a distribution JavaScript.So as a developer you can establish your own environment the way you'd like to work on it. And as long as you stay within the standards of the modules directory, the web images and the template directory, then your site should function normally. In addition, what you'll also notice down the righthand side here is that this site is connected to the Git repo. And it's a very straightforward approach to once you have either use ours or use your own repo, you're able to look at all the remote branches, all the different branches that have been developed for this website, and you're able to create new branches and check out branches. So Core dna has complete integration into Git and offers you the ability to push your changes to a QA environment for testing and then to merge those changes into production. But before you kind of get into the QA environments and pushing to the repos and all that, most developers just want to be able to quickly develop. 
And what Core dna has is a SFTP environment development environment that we've established. And it's very simple to configure. You go down to deployment, you can go down to configure and you can establish your connection to the host. You can set up your mappings for how you want the site to map, and you can then establish it as a connection. So really, to deploy to those environments is very simple. You make a change to a site. So I'm going to go into a site here, and I'm going to update this tag here to say Sam was here, and all we do is save. And you'll notice that the changes are sent instantaneously to our dev server. And when we look at the environment, we can see here that if we press refresh on the dev environment, all of a sudden now Sam was here on the dev environment, and if we want to remove it, it's a simple case of just removing the content. And it will automatically transfer and then just press refresh and the change will be gone. So in this way, developers can quickly create UX's and themes and solutions for their customers in a very localized approach. And then when they're ready, they can then push those changes into production. And so we have here the production version of the Media Center and you'll notice that it has a number of similar directories. You'll see here is the source files we can return and then we have the all JS files. We then have the modules that are being used and they generally mimic the modules that are here. Now, once a developer is ready to push their changes into testing, they're able to then come to their IDE and do a commit and a push. And what happens then is through the use of webhooks, Core dna is able to then apply those changes to the production environment. If we take a longer look at the repo itself, we're able to see that this keeps all the commits that you do. And so this hasn't been updated in a number of months, but we can actually go into those commits and have a look at what were the changes, what exactly changed, and if we want to, we can actually back those changes out. In addition, we can see all the branches that are currently available and at what progress these branches are in terms of the master branch. So we can actually switch between them. We can also see the pull request that have occurred and so on. So all the sites that you work on actually can be found here and you're able to navigate between them. You could do a you can go into a site, clone the site, pull it down, it then becomes available in your IDE, and you can begin work either by doing a deploy to your deploy environment or by doing a commit and push for small changes straight through to your Bitbucket account.  The IDE itself supports the inclusion of Git. It's very simple to set up and also includes the ability to deploy. So as long as your server or your ID can support it, you can then use Core dna to develop out of the box. "

And then we'll deep dive from a technical standpoint to see how the Pages application can be built. So the Pages application is one of the most commonly used applications within Core dna.When you scroll down a page, most likely the Pages application is being used to render the content, whether it be Video content, image Content or different types of components within the site. The Page's content also has the ability for us to create what we call Style Guides, which are the various components that we create for our website user to use. In this case here we can see the variety of components that have been constructed for that particular site.The Pages component also can have content that comes in from other parts of the website. So as we scroll down the bottom here, we can see two blogs that have been posted inside the Style Guide. And when you click on them, it takes you into the Blog Posts area.So how does the Pages module work? Well, let's log into Core dna.The Pages application sits within the Content family over on the right. So when we kick off the Pages application, it serves two major functions. The first one, it provides the various navigations for the different parts of the system. And secondly, it provides the content. So when we look to the left, we can see here the main navigation pane which highlights Insights, Editors, Reader Group, Resources and Sample Page.If we go back to our website, we'll notice media room, insights, resources and sample page. There are a number of menu options missing. The reason for this is one of the first features of the Page's module is its ability to segment content. So if we click on the Editors page, we can go across the top and see the Authority tab. The Authority tab is what allows us to segment content.When we look down the Authority tab, we can see the major components. Firstly, we have what we call Inherited Access. Inherit Access tells the system to go to the parent and look for the access control at the parent. In this case, we've unclick the Inherit Access and by default, if we don't know who you are, you won't see the page. So, because we don't know who's logged in, the system will not show this particular page.If, however, you're part of the Editor Group, you will have all access to this page. So let's see this. In practice, we go over to the login, we log in as Editor and now we'll find the Editors page. When we log out of the system, the system will say no editors Page. This is a really cool feature that can actually allow you to create multiple segments and you can see here, we've used it for the reader group, and within the reader group, we've broken it down into internal readers, external readers and common content.One of the other features of the Pages application is its ability to create multiple menus. And so here when we look down the main navigation bar, we can also see the footer navigation, which corresponds to the bottom of the page, and the info navigation, which is used somewhere within the system to provide linkages. We can also create what we call landing pages. Landing pages are the ones that we define, that customers are sent to and may not see a menu or may want to have specific content that's part of a promotion or a campaign that we may be running. So let's go back to the home page.Now, the Page's application allows you to put content in many as forms. In the details page. You can see here that we can create content. We have publishing settings. We also have some custom fields that we've created to provide us some tagging. In addition, we have the SEO button across the top. This allows us to create focused keywords, the metadata and meta description, and also the social media overrides that we may want to put in place for when people copy the page. We've spoken about the Authority module. We then also have what we call Linked Content. Linked Content provide us the ability to create components that are linked to other parts of the system.I won't go into too much detail into this application. It's part of the application as I'll cover some other areas in terms of attachments. So attachments in this particular implementation of Pages is the way that the site is created. And what we can see here is all the different components that have been created for the page to render. So as we go through, we'll see we have the top image, which is a hero full.We have tapped content. Further down, we have posts by tags from the blogs. And if we go back to the home page of the site, we'll notice that there's the Hero, there's your Tabbed Content. And then these are the posts from your blog posts. And we can continue to build these pages for as far as we like.Editing these pages very easy. Just press the edit button. You asked for the title, you asked for a category. And we'll talk a little bit more about how we construct these categories. And these represent all the components.We then have a link heading, and within here we can also have custom property. So here we've created some custom data, we've created some background colors, we've created some button colors and various other aspects that we want to run for the component.Pages also has the ability for you to allocate layouts. So layouts are the different page layouts that you may want to construct. In this case, we have five different layouts, content layout, a features layout, default layout site, an XML layout and a pricing layout. And we can also see here we have the ID of the page and a Gui ID that can be used to transfer the page across sites from a share perspective, we also have the ability to share the page using social media as long as we configure the social elements that we need. Finally, the config area of the site allows us to configure the various aspects of managing the page's application.So the first part is our Blueprints. Our blueprints are the descriptors for the different types of layouts that we have and also and are used within the layouts area. We also have the categories. So we saw these categories earlier. These are the definitions for the components that we create in the page and where they're actually used.So here we can see the two column, three row blue is used in three pages or four pages and we can go and modify those pages. When we get into the technical aspect of Pages, we'll discover how the ID here is used within the coordinate system to connect the component to the actual descriptor. Here we can also manage properties and these are generally the custom fields for the pages. And here you can see the various dropdown types of properties that we've created for us to use within the categories. And we also have the layouts.And the layouts allow us to connect the layout file and give it a description so we can use it within the system. Finally, we have the manage configuration. So manage configuration throughout the system is where we can extend the platform or provide features to the platform that customers have asked for in the past that allow us to set the application up in a way that makes sense for our use. And you can see here that we have various elements. For example, takeover pages.We may have an upgrade that we've done, we may have metadata that we want to apply and also some SEO bits. That's the first part of our discussion on the Pages application."
How does a DXP differentiate from other platforms?,"A platform that balances marketing and IT needs. A Digital experience platform or DXP allows brands to deliver personalized content based on customer's digital footprint.Core dna has been developed to meet the demands of both developers and marketers. We work to provide developers the most flexible platform, while ensuring marketers have a user-friendly technology that enables them to be in control of their digital assets.This would allow them to create relevant experiences for customers based on what they've been viewing or interacting with in the past. For example, if you like hockey then we can send you a link to buy tickets for an upcoming game; if you're looking for recipes then we can send you some ideas based on the ingredients that you have in your fridge at home right now. The possibilities are endless!We want to help businesses succeed by providing them with the tools they need to engage with their customers on a personal level and make them feel like they're talking directly with someone who understands what they're going through in their lives at that moment in time!

Are there any contracts?,"Standard plans do not require any fixed contracts. There is a simple agreement that covers the use of the software and the content you may produce. For our enterprise clients, we do sign contracts to cover custom setup, extended SLAs and ongoing support."
What is a headless cms?,"Unlike a traditional CMS/eCommerce, which combines content management and front-end delivery, a headless platform has a flexible front-end system to determine how the content is created and presented to the end user. It’s front-end agnostic, meaning that your content is created raw and can be published anywhere, through any framework, thanks to built-in APIs.Coredna is not only a headless platform but also a hybrid headless Platform. We recognized that Marketers still need the flexibility of an easy to use administration, so we created a fully functioning DXP administration panel that allows the marketer to have a dashboard and the ability to manage multiple websites. With the Headless features of the Core dna DXP you can also create a customized publishing platform, this can be useful if you want to simplify administration functions or create a custom user experience.Learn more about headless content management."
What is a Digital Experience Platform (DXP)?,"A DXP or Digital experience platform is a central technogical foundation to be built upon and to support the entire, continuous customer life cycle across all digital channels.From one platform, one login, brands and business can manage content, assets, and interactions across multiple different channels.It allows multichannel delivery via APIs of digital interactions across all touchpoints, including Iot, AR/VR, digital assistants and kiosks.It helps efficiently and effectively create, store, publish and optimize content for any channel – whether it’s a website,mobile app, or social media page.It's a platform where business and IT with various skills and responsibilities work together towards the common goal of customer experience improvement.It helps tracks user behavior on your websites, monitor key performance indicators (KPIs) in real time.It integrates with your tech stack for increased personalization and engagement with customers, and gathercustomer insights from data analytics.Gartner defines a digital experience platform (DXP) as, “an integrated set of technologies, based on a common platform, that provides a broad range of audiences with consistent, secure and personalized access to information and applications across many digital touchpoints. Organizations use DXPs to build, deploy and continually improve websites, portals, mobile and other digital experiences.”An enterprise DXP gives a brand the tools it needs to manage the presentation layer of their digital presence.

What is a decoupled platform?,"A decoupled platform — a term that best describes Core dna — is a headless platform, and then some.With a decoupled platform, your content and other objects like products, orders, blogs are managed separately and can be front-end agnostic, just like a headless platform. Yet, it has front-end delivery tools in the box, like templates, an admin for your staff and other features that can make adopting the platform easier than if it were just a headless platform. These additional tools are designed for people who don't have technical expertise and can simplify your development process. The difference is that the back-end and front-end are not “coupled” to each other through a database like with a traditional CMS. Instead, the front-end and back-end communicate to each other through calls to an API.Learn more about headless content management."
Why do I need to use a headless platform?,"A headless platform gives you a number of benefits. These include:Ability to create your own custom content types that can then be used to build further complex content types that are independent of the original database design.Freedom to develop interfaces based on your own standards without the constraints of your current CMS.The ability for you to distribute your content to multiple channels. For example desktop, mobile, phone, interactive screen, digital banners.A central place for all your content, rather than have it distributed across many different systems.Ability to access content using application programming interfaces (API).Ability to create custom publishing environments that are tailored to your admin requirements.Remove the dependence of your systems on specific systems. You can use API interfaces to access what you need from systems and replace them easily if your needs change.Ability to use microservices for speed and flexibility. Make changes quickly without the need to engineer your CMS; making it faster to get changes done.Developer friendly, no big learning curves for developers to understand new CMS/eCommerce platforms. Easy-to-learn API interface that gives them the ability to create anything using multiple sources of information.Ability to improve performance: by controlling exactly what you want to deliver to your visitor, without the overheads of a traditional CMS/eCommerce.Improved security through access to distinct APIs that can be controlled by the admin.Read this next: Headless CMS vs Decoupled CMS: The Ultimate Guide"
What are the pros and cons of a headless platform?,"ProsFlexible developer environment to create and manage content across multiple channelsAbility to create and deploy tailored customer experiences quicklyAbility to learn, change and iterate direction quicklyShare content programmatically with other systemsCreate workflows and recurring processes that communicate with the platform and other systemsAdvanced security provided by simple interactions through APIsImproved performance, ability to create static content and have websites that are fastScale, ability to handle peaks and large volumes of website content from a single sourceConsHave flexibility that may require developer involvementManual application managementOut-of-the-box functionality may be limitedFlexibility in the presentation layer can be limitedSetup maybe be more complex in terms of structuring data types, components and layoutsSome systems are missing admin/authoring capabilities with features like preview, analytics and permissioningSite control can be split amongst a number of content systemsPersonalization may require more developmentAnalytics capabilities can be limited** Many of the Cons above have been solved within the Core dna platform as we continue to provide hybrid support for the traditional authoring environment.Read this next: Hybrid CMS: A Headless CMS, But With a Front-End"
How is a headless platform different from a decoupled platform?,There are a number of differences between headless and decoupled platforms; these include:Flexible content models that allow you to describe your data in the headless platforms.Advanced APIs that can use query languages for APIs like GraphQL.Headless platforms are designed to deliver content quickly and efficiently without any overhead.Decoupled platforms are generally connected to a display layer templating language for building user interfaces.Headless platforms may not have any display of layer templating. Hybrid platforms like Core dna do still offer templating languages and admin interfaces for the convenience of admins.A high degree of customization & flexibility for developers in the headless platform.
Can traditional CMS/eCommerce be used with a headless platform?,"This depends on the traditional platform. With a headless CMS, the key difference is its ability to create different content types and then make that content available through an application programming interface (API). If a traditional CMS is able to process API requests it can be integrated with a headless platform. If it's not then programmers will need to process the API requests outside of the traditional CMS, through the use of javascript in the display of the website. Understanding what a traditional CMS isA monolithic or traditional cms is a content management system that stores all of its content in a single database. This means that all of your content, including pages, posts, comments, and media, are stored in one place. A monolithic cms is best suited for small websites with relatively simple content structures. If you have a large website with complex content, you may want to consider a different type of content management system.Understanding what a headless CMS isA Headless Content Management System (CMS) enables users to manage and store content without the need for a graphical user interface (GUI). A headless CMS is often used in conjunction with a “front-end” website or application that provides a GUI for end users.You can learn more about headless vs monolithic in this guide: What is a headless CMS The difference between headless vs traditional CMS What is a decoupled CMS Headless vs decoupled CMS Things to consider when choosing a headless CMS Headless CMS case studiesGET IN TOUCH TODAYSchedule a one-to-one consultation with your product specialistHere’s what you can expect:Walkthrough: An introduction of the Core dna platformAnalysis: Personalized recommendations based on your  business needs.Case studies: How other businesses have used Core dna to scale more efficiently Request a Demo "
Is Core dna a headless platform or a decoupled platform?,"Core dna is a decoupled platform, meaning we have headless content management built-in, but we also give you the front-end tools you need to present your content to your end-user."
How do I know if a headless platform is right for me?,"The easiest way to determine if a headless platform is best for you is to ask yourself these questions:What are your business requirements and does a headless platform solve these requirements?Do you have access to qualified individuals to help with the setup and ongoing management of the platform?Can you determine the content types that you will require (e.g. buttons, headers, lists, options, etc.)?Do you want to design your own components using the content types you can define? You can always add components later but planning up front will help with organizing your content for distribution.Determine if you want to enrich your content with templates and styling to create consistent output and not just data.Do you want to test the output from the headless platform using tools that allow you to make API calls?Do you want to configure the destination systems to accept the information?In the case of Core dna, we provide an admin panel to help with the creation of the content and preview of the content. We also give you a number of tools for security and personalization. Finally, we have defined a number of entities that give you the starting point for your project to help with quick deployment.Read this next: How to Choose The Best CMS Platform to Help Drive Your Business Growth"
What front-end frameworks does Core dna support? ,"Core dna is framework agnostic.An agnostic framework means you can create any design using the front-end technology and frameworks that you know and love.We believe in being open-minded and non-discriminatory when it comes to technology choices, and we want our clients to feel empowered to use whatever works best for them and their projects, regardless of whether it's something we've already tried and failed with before! Core dna never requires you to use specific templates or libraries. As a decoupled platform, Core dna also has server side templating that can be used to deliver projects quickly and efficiently using only HTML, CSS and Javascript. The server side frameworks supported are Twig and Smarty.What is an agnostic framework?An approach to software development that doesn't favor any one language or technology over another. Agnosticism is a philosophical position which states that it is not possible to know anything about God or other supernatural beings. A Software Agnostic approach would say that there is no right or wrong when it comes to the tools you use in your job as long as they get the job done.What is Smarty?Smarty is a template engine for PHP. More specifically, it facilitates a manageable way to separate application logic and content from its presentation. This is best described in a situation where the application programmer and the template designer play different roles, or in most cases are not the same person. It is extremely fast. It is efficient since the PHP parser does the dirty work. No template parsing overhead, only compiles once.What is Twig?Twig is a modern template engine for PHP. It's fast. Twig compiles templates down to plain optimized PHP code. The overhead compared to regular PHP code was reduced to the very minimum. It is secure. Twig has a sandbox mode to evaluate untrusted template code. This allows Twig to be used as a template language for applications where users may modify the template design. It is flexible. Twig is powered by a flexible lexer and parser. This allows the developer to define its own custom tags and filters, and create its own DSL.What is a decoupled platform?A decoupled platform is a software architecture where components are independent of each other. This allows for easier development, testing, and maintenance of the individual pieces that make up the whole product or system.Decoupled platform advantages: A decoupled platform will allow your software to be more easily scalable and upgradable as new technologies become available. It also means your developers won't have to worry about updating multiple parts of your application every time there's an update released; they'll just need to update one piece at a time!GET IN TOUCH TODAYSchedule a one-to-one consultation with your product specialistHere’s what you can expect:Walkthrough: An introduction of the Core dna platformAnalysis: Personalized recommendations based on your  business needs.Case studies: How other businesses have used Core dna to scale more efficiently Request a Demo "
What is the difference between monolithic & headless platforms?,"There are a number of differences between Monolithic systems and a Headless system, these include:Monolithic systems have lots of functionality built into them that not all customers need.A headless platform gives you access to entities, examples of these are pages, menus, products, blogs, people, etc. Entities are the base objects that you can then modify and enhance to your requirements.Monolithic systems are more focused on delivering solutions to the end client rather than the developer. Core dna’s platform strikes a balance between the developer environment and the admin environment.Headless platforms in many cases don’t come with admin tools for end clients. Core dna continues to provide admin friendly tools inside our headless platform.Access to information from a monolithic system can be difficult.Monolithic systems require you to establish the infrastructure and the security tools to make them work.Monolithic systems can take time to learn and understand the way they work.Headless platforms allow you to create your own publishing environments.Read this next: Headless CMS vs Decoupled CMS: The Ultimate Guide"

What is Direct to Consumer (D2C),"D2C, or Direct to Customer, is a low barrier-to-entry eCommerce strategy that allows manufacturers and CPG brands to sell directly to the consumer. It bypasses the conventional method of negotiating with a retailer or reseller to get your product on the market. In D2C, brands sell directly to the consumer through an online medium. Going D2C has many advantages, with competitive pricing being a major benefactor for consumers. Other advantages include having direct contact with consumers to get a better understanding of them, and being able to freely experiment with new product releases and test them with a segment of your consumer-based to gain their feedback.For more information visit our ultimate guide to D2C"
What is JAMstack,"How does it work? How does it stack to the current technology?It hosts options utilising the concept of serverless architecture, ie running websites and applications without infrastructure management. JAMstack creates a static website, allowing the developer to construct the content and interfaces that users interact with.What’s the pros and cons of JAMstack? ProsIt loads quickly as it caches all data as a CDN (Content Delivery Network).It’s a secure website with less reliance on a database.It works well with developers as it allows them to use their own tech stack.ConsEditors and marketers would need to be quite technical or trained to create and update the content with coding.It’s time consuming and is a tedious process to customise templates and execute updates.It’s not cohesive. It needs more resources if dynamic features are required for your website as business grows.Heavily reliant on third-party systems and API’s. (If the third-party system goes down, your website will be affected as well).Should you use JAMstack?For organisations that don’t require much maintenance or content changes to its’ website, or if your in-house developers and editors are technically savvy, JAMstack could work.However, responding to the constant market changes and development of new applications, a CMS (Content Management System) may be a better option.
